# pollution-free-path
we intend to provide a path which is least polluted among all possible paths. Due to lack of data we are generating random data and displaying path accordingly.

## we can input waypoints as shown below

### we will get the least polluted path among them as shown below

#### How to use
1.Enter the start location in the "Set start location" search box
2.Enter up to 8 waypoint locations in the "Enter a waypoint" box in any order.
3.Enter the end location in the "Set end location" box
4.Mouseover a location on the left panel to view its address
5.Delete waypoints with the red x; change start/end by entering a new location 

If the start, end, and at least one waypoint are all defined then the optimal route will be displayed on the map, and directions will be displayed in a panel to the right of the map.  
You can hide/show the panel using the button in the top right of the panel.

Final output path is the recommended path with least pollution
